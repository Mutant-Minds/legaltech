## 🗂️ Project Structure

This project is organized to promote modularity, maintainability, and clarity. Below is a high-level overview of the main directories and their purposes:

* **`backend/`**: Contains the server-side code.
    * **`services/`**: Each service in this directory is a self-contained module responsible for a specific business domain or functionality. Services are designed to be loosely coupled and communicate via well-defined interfaces.
        * `src/`: Each service's `src` directory typically includes:
            * `api/`: API definition files.
            * `core/`: Application configuration settings.
            * `db/`: Database-related code.
            * `models/`: Database SQLAlchemy models.
            * `schemas/`: Pydantic data schemas.
            * `services/`: Business logic.
            * `app.py`: Main entry point for the service.
    * `tests/`: Unit tests and integration tests.
    * `example.env`: Example environment variable file.
    * `pyproject.toml`: Poetry project configuration.
    * `README.md`: Service-specific README file.
    * **`libs/`**: Reusable libraries.
* **`docker/`**: Docker configuration files.
* **`docs/`**: Documentation.
    * `architecture.md`: High-level architecture documentation.
    * `api_reference.md`: API reference documentation.
    * `usage_guide.md`: Usage guide.
* **`frontend/`**: Contains the front-end application (e.g., React or Vue).
* **`scripts/`**: Utility scripts.
* **`docker-compose.yml`**: Docker Compose file.
* **`README.md`**: Project README file.

### Code Organization Principles

The following principles guide the project's code organization:

* **Modularity:** Code is divided into distinct modules with clear responsibilities to improve readability and maintainability.

* **Separation of Concerns:** Different layers or aspects of the application (e.g., business logic, data access, API) are separated to reduce complexity.

* **Consistent Conventions:** Naming, file organization, and coding style follow established conventions to ensure uniformity across the codebase.

* **Test Coverage:** Tests are organized alongside the code they cover, with dedicated test directories to ensure comprehensive validation.

This structure helps new contributors quickly understand where to find and place code, and how the different parts of the project relate to each other.

## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.11+
* Docker
* Docker Compose

### Docker Setup

1.  **Navigate to the project root:**

    ```bash
    cd project-root
    ```

2.  **Build and run Docker containers via Docker Compose:**

    ```bash
    docker compose build --no-cache
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## 🧪 Testing & Linting

This project uses a comprehensive suite of tools to ensure code quality, consistency, and security. The testing script orchestrates these checks. This process helps us maintain a high standard of code quality and prevents regressions.

### Tools

* 🛡️ `bandit` - Security vulnerability scanner
* 🧹 `black` - Code formatter
* 🧐 `flake8` - Code style and quality checker
* 🧽 `isort` - Import sorter
* 🐍 `mypy` - Static type checker
* ✅ `pytest` - Testing framework

### Running Tests

To run the full suite of tests and linters for a specific service, use the following command:
   ```bash
    docker-compose run --rm test <service_name>
    docker-compose run --rm test <service_name> --all
   ```
   * `service_name`: The name of the service or library you want to test
   * `--all`: This runs both the unit tests and all linting checks.

### Customizing Test Execution

The project offers flexibility in how you run tests and linters. Here are some common use cases:

* Running Only Unit Tests (with and without coverage):
   ```bash
    docker-compose run --rm test <service_name> --run pytest --cov-report=html
    docker-compose run --rm test <service_name> --skip-coverage
   ```

* Running Specific Linters (e.g. `mypy`, `flake8`) with tool-specific arguments after the tool name:
    ```bash
    docker-compose run --rm test <service_name> --run <tool_name_1> [tool_1_args] --run <tool_name_2> [tool_2_args] ...
    ```

* Skipping Certain Checks:
    ```bash
    docker-compose run --rm test <service_name> --skip <tool_name_1> --skip <tool_name_2> ...
    ```
